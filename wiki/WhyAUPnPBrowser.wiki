= Why a UPnP browser? =

There is basically 3 main reasons to start this project:

  # I have been trying to find a generic UPnP browser to use for troubleshooting my home network when it comes to UPnP, i have not been able to find a application generic enough for my purposes.
  # I would like to learn more about UPnP and this is a god starting point. I have a idea of building a "remote control" for my media center PC and host it on a retired Windows Mobile device to be able to control the media center over the home WLAN.
  # Hopefully it's fun!
